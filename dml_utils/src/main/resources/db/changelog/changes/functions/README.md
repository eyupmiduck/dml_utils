# Stored functions

One function per `.sql` file, grouped by the schema that owns it:

- `dml_utils/` — the caller-facing API (`run_migration_chunks`,
  `run_function_over_table`, the run controls, the explain helpers and the
  inspection/cleanup helpers).
- `dml_utils_lib/` — the engine: the generic catalog and template helpers, and
  the internal routines that populate boundaries, run one chunk and record
  errors.
- `dml_utils_data/` — the data layer: the trigger functions that guard the
  migration tables.

Dependencies point downward: `dml_utils_lib` may reference `dml_utils_data`;
`dml_utils` may reference both; nothing references `dml_utils`.

`changes/functions.xml` loads them one `createProcedure` per `runOnChange`
changeset; the matching drop lives in `changes/functions-rollback/`. Every
routine is `SECURITY INVOKER` unless it genuinely needs `SECURITY DEFINER`.

The chunk executor is deliberately `SECURITY INVOKER`: `process_migration_chunk`
runs caller-supplied SQL with the caller's privileges. Metadata writes are
delegated to owner-owned `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers (`claim_migration_boundary`,
`complete_migration_boundary`, `complete_migration_run`,
`mark_migration_run_cancelled`, and `record_migration_error`), so the worker does
not need direct DML on `dml_utils_data`. The caller role is granted only
`EXECUTE`/`USAGE` plus `SELECT` on the migration metadata (see
`sql_changes/999-grant-privileges.sql`); application-table privileges belong to
the application/login role.

This is not a hard authorization boundary: the metadata helpers are callable by
the caller because the invoker-owned worker runs as that same role. It centralizes
metadata writes and removes direct DML, but a malicious template can still call
the helpers. Treat raw templates as trusted, or add a parser/template allowlist.

One exception: `dml_utils_lib.migration_key_is_canonical` is loaded earlier, by
`changes/sql_changes/005-create-migration-key-check.sql`, because the
`migration_boundary_key_check` constraint is created with its table and calls it.
Its drop lives in `changes/rollback/`.

Each routine file ends with a `COMMENT ON FUNCTION` (or `COMMENT ON PROCEDURE`)
for the routine it creates, using the short form (`schema.name`, no argument
list). If a routine is ever overloaded, include its argument types so the
comment targets the right overload.

## Chunking strategies

A run chunks the driving table one of three ways, recorded in the run's `chunk_by`
(`dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy`):

- **`primary_key`** (the default): fixed-row chunks from the primary-key order.
  The boundaries are primary-key values, so they are stable and a run is
  resumable.
- **`ordered_key`**: fixed-row chunks from the order of a caller-selected unique
  btree index (`i_boundary_key_index`). The index must cover one to three
  `NOT NULL` columns of type `bigint`, `text`, `uuid` or `timestamptz`, use the
  type's default btree opclass and the column's collation, and be ascending with
  `NULLS LAST`. The resolved descriptor is stored with the run, so resume and
  explain use the same key; a resumed run re-validates the stored index and
  fails closed if it no longer matches. For a partition-wise run the index is on
  the partitioned parent and every leaf's matching child index is validated (see below). The chunk SQL must not modify
  the key
  columns: this is a caller contract, not detected, because inspecting the
  template for writes to the key is unreliable. A run whose key is mutated
  should be archived and restarted after the data is corrected.
- **`blocks`**: fixed-block chunks from the physical heap order. The boundaries
  are heap block numbers and a chunk is the half-open ctid range
  `ctid >= '(start,0)' AND ctid < '(end,0)'`, which plans as a TID Range Scan (PostgreSQL 14+). Boundary computation is
  O (1) from `pg_relation_size`, with no
  table scan, and the chunks are physically sequential.

Prefer `primary_key` unless an ordered key or block chunking is specifically
wanted. The block
strategy is only valid for a **quiescent, read-only driving table on a plain
heap** (or on each plain-heap leaf of a partition-wise run), and it has hard
limitations:

- **ctid is not stable.** A non-HOT `UPDATE` changes a tuple's ctid and may move
  it to another block; HOT updates keep it on the page but cannot be relied on.
  A block run assumes the table is not modified while it runs.
- **Heap rewrites change every ctid.** `VACUUM FULL`, `CLUSTER`, `pg_repack`,
  `TRUNCATE`, a tablespace move and rewrite-causing `ALTER TABLE` all rewrite the
  heap. A block run records the driving table's `pg_relation_filepath` and fails
  closed if it changed before a resume, but a rewrite during a run is not
  detected.
- **Inserts land wherever there is free space**, often mid-file, so a block range
  is not a stable partition of the rows.
- **Block chunks have uneven row counts** (fillfactor and dead space), so equal
  blocks is not equal rows.
- **A run is not resumable across a heap rewrite**, and ctid is not preserved by
  a logical `pg_dump`/restore.
- **Plain heap tables only.** ctid is per-partition, so a single-relation blocks
  run cannot use a partitioned parent. A partition-wise blocks run applies the
  strategy to each leaf, which must be a plain heap; a foreign-table leaf is
  rejected.
- **Read-only cannot be proven.** The routines execute caller-supplied SQL with
  the caller's privileges and cannot tell whether it (or another session)
  modifies the driving table, so a quiescent, read-only source is a caller
  contract, not an enforced property.

### Partition-wise runs

Set `i_partition_wise => true` on `run_migration_chunks`,
`populate_migration_boundaries` or `resolve_migration_run` to apply `i_chunk_by`
inside each leaf of a declarative partitioned parent. `i_partition_wise` is a
modifier, not a fourth strategy: `primary_key`, `ordered_key` and `blocks` all
work inside leaves. `i_partition_wise` is a `non_null_boolean`, so an explicit
NULL is rejected (`23514`).

- **Supported shapes:** range, list, hash and multi-level (sub-partitioned)
  trees, found with `pg_partition_tree`. Every leaf must be an ordinary table (`relkind = 'r'`); a foreign-table leaf
  raises `42809` from
  `leaf_partitions`. The parent itself must be `relkind = 'p'` (`42809`
  otherwise).
- **Ordered keys:** the named unique btree index is on the parent; the parent
  descriptor is stored and every storage leaf's matching child index is
  validated (walking multi-level index inheritance). A missing, invalid or
  differently shaped child index fails before the run row is written (`0A000`/`55000`); a missing index is `42704`.
- **Manifest:** creating the run commits the run and one
  `dml_utils_data.migration_run_leaf` row per leaf (deterministic ordinal,
  schema/name/OID, partition bound, per-leaf block filepath, state, boundary
  count, high-water snapshot). An empty leaf is a row with `boundary_count = 0`,
  never an omission; an all-empty tree finalizes with `total_chunks = 0` and no
  terminal boundary.
- **Calculation:** one leaf per committed worker transaction, in ordinal order,
  serialized by a run-keyed advisory lock (a concurrent calculation raises
  `55000`). A failure records `state = 'failed'` with the SQLSTATE/message on the
  leaf and keeps the earlier leaves; `boundaries_calculated_at` stays NULL.
  Re-calling the same label resumes at the first `pending`/`failed` leaf and
  never recalculates a `calculated` leaf.
- **Changed tree:** before continuing calculation and before processing, the
  live leaf set is compared with the manifest (ordinal, schema, name, OID,
  partition bound, and per-leaf block filepath). Any difference raises `55000`;
  earlier progress stays committed. Archive the run and start a new label
  instead of reconciling.
- **Cancellation:** cancelling while leaves are calculating stops launching new
  leaves; calculated leaves keep their boundaries, the rest stay `pending`, and
  the run is terminal. Archive it before reusing the label.
- **Privileges:** the caller needs `SELECT` on every leaf for calculation (`42501` before a run row) and whatever the
  template needs (`UPDATE` in the
  usual case) when its chunks run. A privilege lost after creation surfaces when
  that leaf's chunk runs, with earlier chunks committed; restore it and retry.
- **Explain:** a rendered chunk targets its leaf; for a primary-key run the leaf
  exposes the same key columns, so a plan check can pass the leaf to the
  renderer/EXPLAIN helpers. `blocks` leaf chunks are ctid ranges on that heap.

### Workaround for idempotent transformations

If the transformation is idempotent and every relevant write fires a trigger, a
`BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on the table can apply the same transformation alongside
the chunked bulk pass: a row that moves is then transformed by the trigger
regardless of which chunk it lands in, and applying it twice is harmless. This is
an advanced mitigation, not a guarantee. The transformation must be idempotent,
the trigger must not recurse, and it does not make deletes, concurrent DML or
heap rewrites safe; it does not replace a quiescent source.

RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Processes every chunk of the driving table, up to
`i_threads` `pg_background` workers at a time (default 1). `i_chunk_by` selects
the strategy: `primary_key` (the default) chunks fixed rows in primary-key order;
`ordered_key` chunks fixed rows in the order of `i_boundary_key_index`, a unique
btree index on the driving table; `blocks` chunks physical heap block ranges and
requires a quiescent, read-only plain table (see "Chunking strategies" above).
`i_boundary_key_index` is required for `ordered_key` and rejected for a new run of
the other strategies (`22023`); when resuming an existing run the stored strategy
and index win, and a differing index is ignored with a notice. With
`i_partition_wise` the driving table is a declarative partitioned parent: the run
and its deterministic leaf manifest are created first, each leaf's boundary
starts are calculated in a separate committed worker transaction, the single
terminal boundary is written at finalization, and every chunk is rendered and
executed against its boundary's leaf. A chunk whose next boundary belongs to a
different leaf ends at that leaf's calculation-time high-water snapshot, so
deletes after calculation cannot regress the bound. A run whose
`boundaries_calculated_at` is still NULL resumes calculation at its first
pending/failed leaf instead of processing; the live leaf set/identity/bounds (and
per-leaf block filepaths) are compared with the manifest before calculation and
processing and any change raises `55000`. Calculation is serialized by a
run-keyed advisory lock, so a concurrent resume fails closed rather than
duplicating boundaries. Each
worker runs one chunk in its own transaction; the coordinator only schedules
and holds no locks on the driving table. On a failed chunk the coordinator
records it, stops launching new chunks, lets the workers already in flight
commit their current chunk, and then re-raises the error, leaving the run
incomplete so it can be resumed. `i_threads` must not exceed
`max_worker_processes` (`22023` otherwise), and parallel execution is not
always faster: the chunks never overlap, but they still contend for the same
table's locks and pages. `i_sleep_ms` adds a delay after each successfully
completed chunk (except the final one), which throttles WAL generation and
therefore helps when replication lag is the constraint. A NULL or negative
value is rejected by the `non_negative_integer` domain with a domain
violation (`23514`); there is no arbitrary upper bound, so an operator can intentionally choose a very long
delay (cancellation remains responsive). It is stored on the run
like `i_threads`; a resumed run uses the stored value, and
`set_migration_run_sleep_ms` adjusts it between calls. With several threads, up
to that many chunks can still be in flight, so use a small thread count and/or
smaller chunks for strict pacing. `i_sql_text` is a template with
`<driving_table>` and `<chunking_clause>` (see `render_chunk_sql`). Reuses the
active run for the label, or creates it by running
`dml_utils_lib.populate_migration_boundaries` in a worker so its boundaries
commit before the chunks run (run resolution is delegated to
`dml_utils_lib.resolve_migration_run`). A resumed run uses the recorded SQL
text, chunk size, strategy, key, threads, sleep and driving table; a differing
input is ignored with a notice, so the boundaries and the rendered chunk SQL
always refer to the same table. Use `set_migration_run_sql_text`,
`set_migration_run_threads` or `set_migration_run_sleep_ms` to change the
recorded SQL text, thread count or per-chunk delay of an unfinished run. Each chunk
worker claims its boundary and commits autonomously, so a re-run resumes at the
first unclaimed boundary. The run records three actual-server-time (`clock_timestamp()`) milestones: `started_at` when
the run begins (the boundary
calculation starts) and `boundaries_calculated_at` when the range calculation
finishes, both written by `populate_migration_boundaries` in its worker's
transaction so they commit with the run and persist across a failed processing
attempt; and `completed_at` when the chunks finish, written in the caller's
transaction so a failed attempt rolls it back. Raises `unique_violation` (`23505`)
when another active run already exists for the label, and re-raises a chunk
worker's failure
with its original SQLSTATE. `RAISE NOTICE` and returns when the run is already
complete. A run cancelled with `cancel_migration_run` stops launching, cancels
the in-flight workers, marks the run and its remaining boundaries cancelled and
returns; a cancelled run is terminal. Run under `READ COMMITTED`; do not hold locks on the driving table
across the call. `i_poll_timeout_ms` is how long the coordinator waits for a
worker before re-checking (`pg_background_wait_any`): the default `1` keeps
per-chunk detection latency low, and a larger value polls less often, cutting
coordinator CPU for chunks that run in non-trivial time. It must be positive:
`0` is rejected because `pg_background_wait_any` treats a non-positive timeout
as wait-forever.

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The read-only companion to
`run_migration_chunks`: it returns `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` of the SQL a chunked
run would generate, one row per statement, without executing anything and
without writing a run or boundaries. `o_plan_kind` is `boundary_population` (the
range scan and boundary INSERT), `chunk_non_final` (a half-open range) or
`chunk_final`; `o_sql_text` is the exact SQL that was explained. The boundary
INSERT is explained with a synthetic run id (`0`), which plans as a `ModifyTable`
without evaluating the foreign key. For `primary_key` and `ordered_key` the chunk
ranges come from `dml_utils_lib.synthetic_chunk_boundary_values` (a `<` non-final
and a `<=` final range); for `blocks` they are two representative half-open ctid
ranges. `ordered_key` requires `i_boundary_key_index`; the other strategies reject
it (`22023`). Either way the ranges are synthetic, so their row estimates may
differ from a real chunk. It is `VOLATILE` because PostgreSQL forbids `EXPLAIN` in
a non-volatile function. Use it to inspect the plans before running
`run_migration_chunks`.

```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The explicit-boundary companion to
`explain_migration_chunks`: it explains exactly one chunk, whose start and end
boundaries the caller supplies as one text value per key column, in key order.
`i_chunk_by` selects the key: `primary_key` (the default) or `ordered_key` with
`i_boundary_key_index`. `o_plan_kind` is `chunk_non_final` for a half-open range or
`chunk_final` for the final, inclusive chunk; `o_sql_text` is the SQL that was
explained. Use it to explain a real chunk (for example a boundary pair read from
`dml_utils.migration_boundaries`) instead of only the synthetic representative
ranges, which is the only way to see the prefix-equality predicate shapes a
multi-column key produces when the leading key columns do not differ between the
boundaries. Block chunks are rejected with `feature_not_supported` (`0A000`): a
`blocks` run's boundaries are block numbers that render a ctid range, so use
`explain_migration_chunks` for those synthetic plans. The values are validated
and cast by their column's kind, and a reversed range, an empty non-final range,
or an array whose length does not match the key is rejected with
`invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`). It resolves no run, reads no boundaries and
writes nothing.

### `dml_utils.set_migration_run_sql_text(i_label, i_sql_text)`

```sql
i_label    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_sql_text dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Replaces the recorded `sql_text` of the unfinished (`completed_at IS NULL`) run for the label, so
the next `run_migration_chunks`
call uses the adjusted SQL. Validates the new SQL as a chunking template (raising `invalid_parameter_value`, `22023`, if
it is not), and raises
`no_data_found` (`P0002`) when there is no unfinished run for the label. Use
this to adjust the SQL of an existing run (for example to fix a bad execution
plan) instead of passing a changed template to a resumed `run_migration_chunks`
call, which would ignore it.

RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. A wrapper for `run_migration_chunks` that calls
a user-supplied function once per row of the driving table, chunk by chunk.
Instead of a hand-written template, the caller supplies a function whose
arguments are the driving table's primary-key columns, in key order, and which
returns `void`. The wrapper builds the per-row template
(`SELECT <fn>(t.<pk1>, ...) FROM <driving_table> WHERE <chunking_clause>`) and
delegates to `run_migration_chunks`, so it resumes by label exactly like a base
run. The function's argument types must equal the primary-key column types in key
order and it must return `void`; a missing function, a non-`void` return, or
mismatched argument types raise `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`) before any
run is created. When `i_label` is NULL a deterministic label is derived from the
driving table, function, filter and chunking strategy, so re-running the same
call resumes the same run and calls that differ only in those derive different
runs. A non-NULL `i_filter` is ANDed onto every chunk's range predicate (referencing the driving table through the fixed
alias `t`), so only the rows it
matches are passed to the function; a filter that contains `<driving_table>` or
`<chunking_clause>` is rejected when the template is validated. `i_chunk_by`
selects the strategy; `blocks` requires a quiescent, read-only driving table and
is unsafe when the function updates the driving table in place. Because a resumed
run uses the recorded SQL text and strategy, use `set_migration_run_function` to
point an unfinished run at a different function or filter. `i_poll_timeout_ms` and
`i_sleep_ms` are passed through to `run_migration_chunks` (see there for their
meaning); `i_sleep_ms` seeds a new run and a resumed run uses the stored value.

```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The read-only companion to
`run_function_over_table`: it validates the function against the driving table's
primary key, builds the per-row template and returns the same three plans as
`explain_migration_chunks` (`boundary_population`, `chunk_non_final`,
`chunk_final`) for the given chunking strategy. A missing function, a non-`void`
return or mismatched argument types raise `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`)
before any plan is produced. A non-NULL `i_filter` is ANDed onto the chunk plans'
range predicate; the boundary-population plan (which does not use the template)
is unaffected. For `blocks`, the driving table must be a plain heap.

```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The explicit-boundary companion to
`explain_function_over_table`: it validates the function against the driving
table's primary key, builds the per-row template and explains exactly one chunk
whose start and end boundaries the caller supplies as one text value per
primary-key column, in key order. Only the `primary_key` strategy is explained:
a `blocks`-strategy chunk is a half-open ctid range and cannot be expressed
here. It returns one `chunk_non_final` or `chunk_final` row. A non-NULL
`i_filter` is ANDed onto the chunk predicate. Use
it to explain a real chunk of the per-row call, including the prefix-equality
shapes the synthetic ranges never produce. It resolves no run, reads no
boundaries and writes nothing.

### `dml_utils.set_migration_run_function(i_label, i_function_schema_name, i_function_name [, i_filter])`

```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Replaces the recorded `sql_text` of the unfinished run for
the label with the template that calls the given function over the run's driving
table (which is immutable), so the next `run_function_over_table` call uses the
adjusted function. Validates the function against the driving table's primary
key (raising `invalid_parameter_value`, `22023`, on a mismatch) and raises
`no_data_found` (`P0002`) when there is no unfinished run for the label. A
non-NULL `i_filter` is ANDed onto each chunk's range predicate; a NULL `i_filter`
removes any filter from the stored template.

i_label   dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_threads dml_utils_data.positive_integer
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Replaces the recorded `threads` of the unfinished (`completed_at IS NULL`) run for the label, so the
next `run_migration_chunks`
call uses the adjusted worker count. Raises `no_data_found` (`P0002`) when there
is no unfinished run for the label. Use this to tune the parallelism of an
existing run instead of passing a changed `i_threads` to a resumed call, which
would ignore it.

### `dml_utils.set_migration_run_sleep_ms(i_label, i_sleep_ms)`

```sql
i_label    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_sleep_ms dml_utils_data.non_negative_integer
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Replaces the recorded per-chunk sleep of the unfinished (`completed_at IS NULL`) run for the label,
so the next `run_migration_chunks`
call waits that many milliseconds after each successful chunk before launching
another. Raises a domain violation (`23514`) for a NULL or negative value and
`no_data_found` (`P0002`) when there is no unfinished run for the label. A
coordinator already processing the run keeps the value it read at its start, so
this changes the next call (a restart/resume), not a run in progress.

### `dml_utils.archive_migration_run(i_label)`

```sql
i_label dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS bigint
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Sets `archived_at` on the active (not archived) run for the
label, if any, so the label can be reused; returns the archived `run_id`, or
NULL when the label had no active run. Pair it with
`dml_utils_lib.populate_migration_boundaries` to rerun a label: populate,
archive, populate again.

### `dml_utils.cancel_migration_run(i_label)`

```sql
i_label dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS bigint
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Cancels the active (not archived, unfinished) migration run
for the label, if any: sets its `cancelled_at`, marks the unclaimed pending
boundaries `cancelled_at`, and returns the `run_id`, or NULL when there was no
active unfinished run. Boundaries held by an in-flight worker are left for
`run_migration_chunks` to mark after it cancels that worker. A cancelled run is
terminal: archive it with `archive_migration_run` and create a new run to
resume.

### `dml_utils.delete_archived_migration_runs()` and `dml_utils.delete_archived_migration_runs(i_label)`

```sql
-- delete_archived_migration_runs(): no arguments
-- delete_archived_migration_runs(i_label):
i_label dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS bigint
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Deletes archived runs — every one, or only those for the
label — and returns the number deleted. Deleting a run cascades to its
`migration_boundary` and `migration_error` rows. The overloads share a
changeset (`function-dml_utils.delete_archived_migration_runs`).

### `dml_utils.migration_run_summary(i_label)`

```sql
i_label dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS TABLE
( run_id, label, chunk_size, chunk_by, threads, sleep_ms,
    driving_table_schema_name, driving_table_name, driving_table_relation_filepath,
    created_at, started_at, boundaries_calculated_at, completed_at, cancelled_at, archived_at,
    boundary_count, completed_boundary_count, error_count)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns one high-level row per run for the label,
including the chunking strategy (`chunk_by`), the thread count, the per-chunk
sleep, the block run's physical filepath (`driving_table_relation_filepath`), the
number of boundaries (chunk starts plus
the terminal boundary), how many are completed, and the number of recorded
errors. Use `migration_errors` to list the errors themselves.

### `dml_utils.migration_errors(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS TABLE
    (error_id, boundary_no, sqlstate, message, created_at)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the run's recorded errors, ordered by
`error_id`.

### `dml_utils.migration_boundaries(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS TABLE
    (boundary_no, boundary_id, started_at, completed_at)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the run's chunk boundaries in order.
`boundary_id` is a `dml_utils_data.migration_key`: position-aligned arrays, one
per key kind. Index i is the i-th key column, so a bigint key's first
column is `(boundary_id).bigint_values[1]`. A `started_at` of `NULL` means the
chunk has not been claimed; a `completed_at` of `NULL` (with `started_at` set)
means it is in progress.

## `dml_utils_lib`

`dml_utils_lib` is the engine. It may reference `dml_utils_data`, but never
`dml_utils`.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_schema_exists(i_schema_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `invalid_schema_name` (`3F000`) when the
schema does not exist.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_table_exists(i_schema_name, i_table_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `undefined_table` (`42P01`) when the table
does not exist in the schema.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_partitioned_table(i_schema_name, i_table_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `undefined_table` (`42P01`) when the
relation does not exist, or `wrong_object_type` (`42809`) when it is not a
declarative partitioned table (`relkind = 'p'`), so a non-partitioned driving
table is rejected before any leaf is enumerated.

### `dml_utils_lib.leaf_partitions(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_chunk_by)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_chunk_by    dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy
RETURNS TABLE
(leaf_ordinal integer, leaf_schema_name text, leaf_name text,
    leaf_oid oid, leaf_bound text, relation_filepath text)
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Enumerates the storage leaves below a declarative
partitioned parent with `pg_partition_tree`, expanding sub-partitioned tables,
and numbers them by the manifest order: partition-bound expression, then schema,
then name, then OID, all byte-wise (`COLLATE "C"`). Each row carries the leaf
identity, its `pg_get_expr(relpartbound)` snapshot and, for
`chunk_by = 'blocks'`, its `pg_relation_filepath`; the filepath is NULL for the
key strategies. A leaf with no rows is still returned (emptiness is a calculation
result). Raises `wrong_object_type` (`42809`) for a non-partitioned parent or a
leaf that is not an ordinary table (for example a foreign-table partition), and
`insufficient_privilege` (`42501`) when the caller cannot `SELECT` a leaf.

### `dml_utils_lib.primary_key_attributes(i_schema_name, i_table_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS TABLE
(ordinality integer, column_name name, column_oid oid,
    column_type regtype, key_kind text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The single catalog reader for a table's primary
key: `primary_key_columns` and `primary_key_kinds` delegate to it, so the key
order and the one-to-three-column validation live in one place. Each row is one
key column in key order, with its ordinal position, name, type oid, type and
collapsed boundary kind (`bigint`/`text`/`uuid`/`timestamptz`, or NULL for an
unsupported type). Raises `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`) when the table has
no primary key or more than 3 key columns.

### `dml_utils_lib.primary_key_columns(i_schema_name, i_table_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS name[]
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the table's primary-key columns in key
order (from the index, so a key declared `(b, a)` returns `{b, a}`), raising
`invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`) when the table has no primary key or more
than 3 key columns. Delegates the column read to `primary_key_attributes`.

### `dml_utils_lib.primary_key_kinds(i_schema_name, i_table_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS text[]
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the boundary key kind of each primary-key
column, in key order: `bigint` for `smallint`/`integer`/`bigint`, `text` for a
`text` key, `uuid` for a `uuid` key and `timestamptz` for a `timestamptz` key.
Raises `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`) for any other type.

### `dml_utils_lib.ordered_key_attributes(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS TABLE
(ordinality integer, column_name name, column_oid oid,
    column_type regtype, key_kind text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The single catalog reader and validator for an
ordered key: resolves the named unique btree index on the driving table to one
row per key column in index order, with its ordinal position, name, type oid,
type and collapsed boundary kind (`bigint`, `text`, `uuid` or `timestamptz`).
`INCLUDE` columns are ignored. It rejects:

The index must be a valid, live, unique btree index on one to three simple
`NOT NULL` columns using the type's default btree operator class and the
column's own collation. An exclusion-constraint index is rejected by the
non-btree check, because PostgreSQL backs exclusion constraints only with
gist/spgist.

### `dml_utils_lib.ordered_key_columns(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS name[]
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the ordered-key columns in index order,
delegating validation to `ordered_key_attributes`.

### `dml_utils_lib.ordered_key_kinds(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS text[]
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the collapsed boundary key kind of each
ordered-key column in index order, delegating validation to
`ordered_key_attributes`.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_usable_ordered_key(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises the `ordered_key_attributes` error when the
index cannot serve as an ordered key, and returns normally when it can. Used by
the run path and by resume validation. A caller that also needs the descriptor
should read `ordered_key_attributes` once instead of calling this wrapper and
then `ordered_key_columns`/`ordered_key_kinds`, which would repeat the catalog
read and validation.

### `dml_utils_lib.ordered_key_leaf_indexes(i_parent_index_oid)`

```sql
i_parent_index_oid oid
RETURNS TABLE
    (leaf_oid oid, child_index_oid oid, child_index_name text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Walks a partitioned index's inheritance tree once
and returns one row per storage leaf with its matching descendant index. Index
inheritance mirrors the table tree, so a multi-level partition's leaf index is
not a direct child of the root; both partition-wise ordered-key validators use
this helper.

### `dml_utils_lib.ordered_key_attributes_for_index(i_index_oid, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_index_oid   oid
i_schema_name text
i_table_name  text
i_index_name  text
RETURNS TABLE
(ordinality integer, column_name name, column_oid oid,
    column_type regtype, key_kind text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The shared ordered-key shape validator: it takes an
index OID and returns its key columns after applying the same checks as
`ordered_key_attributes` (btree, unique, valid, non-partial, 1–3 simple
ascending `NOT NULL` columns with default opclass and the column collation). The
names are used only in error messages. It lets the partition-wise path validate
a parent index and each leaf's child index without duplicating the rules.

### `dml_utils_lib.partitioned_ordered_key_attributes(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS TABLE
(ordinality integer, column_name name, column_oid oid,
    column_type regtype, key_kind text)
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates a partition-wise ordered key: the
driving table must be declarative partitioned, every storage leaf must have the
matching descendant child index (walking multi-level index inheritance) that is
itself usable, and the parent index must satisfy the ordered-key contract.
Returns the parent index's key columns and kinds. Raises `42704` for a missing
index, `0A000` for a non-partitioned parent or a leaf without a matching child
index, and `0A000`/`55000` for an unusable parent or child index. It is
`VOLATILE` because `leaf_partitions` calls the volatile `pg_partition_tree`.

### `dml_utils_lib.partitioned_ordered_key_columns(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS name[]
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns a partition-wise ordered key's columns in
key order, delegating validation to `partitioned_ordered_key_attributes`.

### `dml_utils_lib.partitioned_ordered_key_kinds(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS text[]
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns a partition-wise ordered key's boundary
kinds in key order, delegating validation to
`partitioned_ordered_key_attributes`.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_partitioned_ordered_key_leaves(i_run_id, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_run_id     bigint
i_index_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates the ordered-key child index of every
leaf already snapshotted in a partition-wise run's manifest, walking the
multi-level index inheritance tree once. Because it uses the manifest rather
than a fresh enumeration, a leaf attached between the descriptor read and the
manifest insert cannot be stored without its child index being validated. Raises
`42704` for a missing parent index, `0A000` for a leaf without a matching child
index, and `0A000`/`55000` for an unusable child index.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_boundary_key_index(i_chunk_by, i_boundary_key_index)`

```sql
i_chunk_by           dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy
i_boundary_key_index name
RETURNS void
```

`IMMUTABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`) when
`i_chunk_by` is NULL, when `ordered_key` is selected without an index, or when an
index is supplied for `primary_key` or `blocks`. Shared by the new-run and
explain paths so the strategy/index rule lives in one place; a resumed run keeps
its stored strategy and index instead of calling this.

### `dml_utils_lib.migration_key_is_canonical(i_key)`

```sql
i_key dml_utils_data.migration_key
RETURNS boolean
```

`IMMUTABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. True when the key is a canonical boundary key:
its arity is one to three, every present array shares that arity, exactly one
array holds a non-NULL element at each index, and no present array is empty or
all-NULL. The `migration_boundary_key_check` constraint calls it.

### `dml_utils_lib.migration_key_values(i_key, i_key_kinds)`

```sql
i_key       dml_utils_data.migration_key
i_key_kinds text[]
RETURNS text[]
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Flattens a position-aligned `migration_key`
into one text value per key column, in key order, using `i_key_kinds` to
pick the array for each position. The chunk predicate re-casts each value. It is
`STABLE` rather than `IMMUTABLE` because `timestamptz::text` depends on the
session time zone.

### `dml_utils_lib.migration_key_pair_values(i_start_key, i_end_key, i_key_kinds)`

```sql
i_start_key dml_utils_data.migration_key
i_end_key   dml_utils_data.migration_key
i_key_kinds text[]
RETURNS record (o_start_values text[], o_end_values text[])
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Flattens a chunk's two boundaries (its start
and end `migration_key`) in one pass, returning one text value per key
column for each, in key order. It is the two-key form of
`migration_key_values`, so the coordinator extracts both bounds with a single
call per chunk instead of two. It is `STABLE` for the same
`timestamptz::text` session-time-zone reason. Rejects malformed kinds or an
unsupported kind with `22023`.

###

`dml_utils_lib.build_function_chunk_template(i_table_schema_name, i_table_name, i_function_schema_name, i_function_name [, i_filter])`

```sql
i_table_schema_name    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name           dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_function_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_function_name        dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_filter               text DEFAULT NULL
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the `<driving_table>`/`<chunking_clause>`
template that calls the given function once per row, passing the driving table's
primary-key columns in key order (`SELECT <fn>(t.<pk1>, ...) FROM <driving_table> WHERE <chunking_clause>`).
Resolves the primary key via `primary_key_columns` and validates that the
function exists and returns `void` with argument types equal to the primary-key
column types in key order; raises `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`) otherwise. A
non-NULL `i_filter` is appended as ` AND (<i_filter>)`, so only the rows it
matches are passed to the function; it references the driving table through the
fixed alias `t`.

###

`dml_utils_lib.resolve_migration_run(i_sql_text, i_driving_table_schema_name, i_driving_table_name, i_label, i_chunk_size, i_threads, i_driving_table_alias [, i_chunk_by, i_sleep_ms, i_boundary_key_index])`

                o_key_columns name[], o_key_kinds text[])
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. The run-resolution half of `run_migration_chunks`: it reuses
the active run for the label or creates one (populating its boundaries in a
`pg_background` worker so they commit autonomously), then returns the run id,
whether it was already complete, the effective sql_text/schema/table/alias/
threads, sleep and chunking strategy (the stored values for a resumed run,
ignoring differing inputs with a notice), and whether the run is partition-wise, plus the boundary key columns and kinds
(the stored ordered-key descriptor for `ordered_key`, the real primary key for
`primary_key`, or a single `bigint` block number for `blocks`). For a new
partition-wise run the worker only creates the run and its pending leaf manifest;
`run_migration_chunks` then calculates the leaves and finalizes. A resumed run
keeps its stored `partition_wise` flag, ignoring a differing input with a notice.
`i_boundary_key_index` is required for a new `ordered_key` run and rejected for a
new run of the other strategies (`22023`); a resumed run keeps its stored index,
and a differing input is ignored with a notice. A resumed ordered-key run
re-validates the stored index and descriptor and raises `55000` if they no longer
match. A resumed block run fails closed if the driving table's physical filepath
changed. It validates the thread count against `max_worker_processes` before
creating a run.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_chunking_template(i_sql_text)`

```sql
i_sql_text dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`IMMUTABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`)
unless `i_sql_text` contains `<driving_table>` and `<chunking_clause>` exactly
once each.

###

`dml_utils_lib.render_chunk_sql(i_sql_text, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds, i_start_values, i_end_values, i_is_final)`

```sql
i_sql_text          dml_utils_data.non_null_text

i_start_values      text[]
i_end_values        text[]
i_is_final          boolean
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates the template (see
`assert_chunking_template`) and returns it with `<driving_table>` replaced by
`"<schema>"."<table>" "<alias>"` and `<chunking_clause>` replaced by a
parenthesized disjunction of axis-aligned boxes that exactly tiles the
lexicographic key range `[start, end)`. Let `d` be the first key column whose
start and end differ; the boxes are the lower tail (`c_d = start_d` and the
suffix `>=` the lower suffix), the middle (`start_d < c_d < end_d`) and the upper
tail (`c_d = end_d` and the suffix `<` the upper suffix), i.e. `2*(n-d)+1` boxes
for an `n`-column key (a three-column key uses 5, 3 or 1 boxes). The final
chunk's last upper bound is `<=` so the captured maximum row is included; a key
that differs only in its last column is a single scalar range and a key whose
bounds are all equal is a single row. Each box is a prefix of equalities plus a
range on the next column, so PostgreSQL estimates it column by column and uses
the key index, where a single row-value comparison is mis-estimated and
can sequential-scan the whole table. Each
`i_key_kinds` entry must be `bigint`, `text`, `uuid` or `timestamptz` and is
interpolated as the literal's cast, so any other value raises `22023`; the
arrays must all have the same length, and a NULL start or end value raises
`22023` (a NULL would render as an unquoted `NULL`, making the predicate match
no rows). The start and end
values are the text form of the packed boundary key. Identifiers are quoted with
`%I` and values with `%L`, so neither substitution can reintroduce a token. It
is the one-shot pair of `prepare_chunk_sql_render` and
`render_prepared_chunk_sql`; a caller that renders many chunks for one table
calls those two directly and prepares once.

###

`dml_utils_lib.prepare_chunk_sql_render(i_sql_text, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds)`

```sql
i_sql_text            dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_schema_name         dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name          dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_alias         dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_key_columns         name[]
i_key_kinds           text[]
RETURNS record
    (o_template text, o_column_names text[], o_key_collations text[])
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates the chunking template (see
`assert_chunking_template`) and the key columns and kinds once, and
returns the run-invariant render context for `render_prepared_chunk_sql`: the
template with both `<driving_table>` and `<chunking_clause>` replaced by internal
sentinels, the alias-qualified quoted column names, and each text column's
collation (the quoted collation name, `default`, or NULL when
the column is not in the catalog, in which case the per-chunk render compares
under the default operator). The caller must pass the kind resolved from the
catalog for each column; the public wrappers derive both together, so a direct
lib caller is responsible for keeping them consistent. It reads the catalog for
the collations and rejects an unsupported kind, a NULL/empty column name, a
malformed columns/kinds array, a template that is not a valid chunking template,
or a template containing a reserved substitution character (`22023`). The
schema/table/alias identifiers are validated per render by
`render_prepared_chunk_sql`, which rejects one containing a reserved character.
Prepare once per run and pass the result to `render_prepared_chunk_sql` for every
chunk; the driving table is selected per render, so the same context renders the
parent or any leaf of a partition-wise run.

###

`dml_utils_lib.render_prepared_chunk_sql(i_template, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_column_names, i_key_kinds, i_key_collations, i_start_values, i_end_values, i_is_final)`

```sql
i_template       text
i_schema_name    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name     dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_alias    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_column_names   text[]
i_key_kinds      text[]
i_key_collations text[]
i_start_values   text[]
i_end_values     text[]
i_is_final       boolean
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Renders one chunk from the context returned by
`prepare_chunk_sql_render`: it validates and casts the start/end boundary values,
builds the same axis-aligned box disjunction as `render_chunk_sql`, substitutes
the caller's driving table (the parent or one leaf) for the template's
driving-table sentinel, and substitutes the clause for its sentinel. It reads no
catalog, so calling it per chunk avoids repeating the template validation and
quoting that `render_chunk_sql` would redo; a partition-wise run prepares from
the parent once and passes each boundary's leaf here. A NULL template, a prepared
template without either sentinel, a NULL `i_is_final`, malformed arrays, a NULL or
invalid-for-its-kind boundary value, or a reversed/empty non-final range raises
`22023`.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_no_active_run_for_label(i_label)`

```sql
i_label dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `unique_violation` (`23505`) when a not-archived
migration run already exists for the label.

###

`dml_utils_lib.populate_migration_boundaries(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_label, i_sql_text, i_chunk_size [, i_threads, i_chunk_by, i_driving_table_alias, i_sleep_ms, i_boundary_key_index])`

```sql

i_sleep_ms    dml_utils_data.non_negative_integer DEFAULT 0
i_boundary_key_index name DEFAULT NULL
i_partition_wise dml_utils_data.non_null_boolean DEFAULT FALSE
RETURNS bigint
```

`SECURITY DEFINER`, with a pinned `search_path`. Creates a
`dml_utils_data.migration_run` row for the label, with the recorded SQL text,
chunk size, strategy, threads, per-chunk sleep, driving table and driving table
alias (storing the alias and sleep at creation so a resume uses the same values),
records the run's `started_at` (the run start, when the calculation begins), then
populates the boundaries for the strategy and records `boundaries_calculated_at`
(when the range calculation finishes) and `total_chunks` (the boundary count minus
the terminal high-water boundary, clamped to 0 for an empty source); returns the
new `run_id`. With `i_partition_wise` the parent must be a declarative partitioned
table: the function validates the parent, every leaf and the caller's `SELECT` on
each leaf, inserts the run with `partition_wise = true` and one pending manifest
row per leaf (schema/name/OID/bound), and returns *without* boundaries or
`boundaries_calculated_at`; the per-leaf calculation is a separate resumable
step (see `calculate_migration_run_boundaries`). For `primary_key`
it inserts one fixed-row chunk boundary per chunk plus a terminal high-water
boundary at the captured maximum primary key; for `ordered_key` it does the same
from the order of `i_boundary_key_index` and stores the index, columns and kinds
with the run; for `blocks` it inserts one start
boundary every `i_chunk_size` heap blocks plus a one-past-end terminal boundary
and records the driving table's physical filepath. Both timestamps are written in
this worker's transaction, so they commit with the run and persist across a
failed processing attempt. For `primary_key` the source table must exist and have
a primary key of one to three columns, each of a supported type (`smallint`,
`integer`, `bigint`, `text` or `uuid`); the columns are identified from the
catalog in key order, not assumed to be `id`. For `ordered_key` the named index
must be a valid unique btree index on one to three `NOT NULL` columns of a
supported type (`bigint`, `text`, `uuid` or `timestamptz`), with the type's
default opclass and the column's collation; `i_boundary_key_index` is required for
`ordered_key` and rejected for the other strategies (`22023`). For `blocks` the
table must be a plain heap. Each boundary is stored as
`dml_utils_data.migration_key`, which holds position-aligned arrays — index i is
the value of key column i in the array matching that column's kind, and
exactly one array element is non-NULL per index. The `migration_boundary_key_check`
constraint enforces that: each present array must have a non-NULL element (so an
all-NULL or empty array is rejected), present arrays must share one length of one
to three, and exactly one of the four arrays holds a non-NULL value at each
index. Raises `23505` when
an active (not archived) run already exists for the label. The
`migration_boundary` rows are inserted with their own `started_at` and
`completed_at` null. An empty source produces a run with no boundaries. Later
inserts above the captured maximum fall outside the terminal boundary and are not
processed. Because the definer owner scans the driving table, the function checks
the effective caller's `SELECT` privilege first (`42501` otherwise) and the owner
must also be able to read that table.

###

`dml_utils_lib.assert_migration_tree_unchanged(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Re-enumerates a partition-wise run's live leaves
with `leaf_partitions` and compares the result with the manifest: leaf count,
ordinal order, schema/name/OID, partition-bound expression and, for `blocks`, the
per-leaf filepath. Any difference raises `invalid_transaction_initiation`
(`55000`), so calculation and processing never mix stale ranges with a new tree.
A single-relation run is a no-op. The caller's `SELECT` on every leaf is checked
by the enumeration, so a lost privilege also fails closed (`42501`).

### `dml_utils_lib.migration_run_calculation_lock_key(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS bigint
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the bigint advisory-lock key that
serializes boundary calculation for a run, derived from the run id with a
`dml_utils.migration_run.calculation.` prefix. It is `STABLE` rather than
`IMMUTABLE` because `pg_catalog.format` is not immutable.

### `dml_utils_lib.calculate_migration_run_boundaries(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Calculates a partition-wise run's boundaries one
leaf per `pg_background` transaction until every leaf is calculated, then
finalizes the run in its own worker transaction (terminal boundary and totals).
The run-keyed transaction-scoped advisory lock makes a concurrent calculation
fail closed with `55000`. The live tree is compared with the manifest before the
loop and before finalization, and each claimed leaf is re-checked. A failing leaf
is marked failed on the manifest with its SQLSTATE and message in a separate
worker transaction before the original error is re-raised, so a later call
resumes at that leaf. A cancelled run stops without finalizing and keeps its
pending leaves. A single-relation run is rejected (`22023`).

### `dml_utils_lib.record_migration_leaf_error(i_run_id, i_leaf_ordinal, i_sqlstate, i_error_message)`

```sql
i_run_id       bigint
i_leaf_ordinal integer
i_sqlstate     dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_error_message dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY DEFINER` (pinned `search_path`). Marks one manifest leaf
`failed`, resets its count/timestamp and records the SQLSTATE and message. A
calculated leaf is never downgraded and a missing leaf is a no-op. The
coordinator calls it in an autonomous `pg_background` transaction after a leaf
worker fails, so the failure survives the re-raise and an operator can see which
leaf failed.

###

`dml_utils_lib.build_boundary_population_sql(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds, i_run_id, i_chunk_size)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_key_columns name[]
i_key_kinds   text[]
i_run_id      bigint
i_chunk_size  bigint
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the statement that scans the driving
table in boundary-key order and inserts the run's chunk boundaries as the
contiguous sequence `0..N` (one start per chunk plus the terminal high-water
boundary). The key may be the primary key or a caller-selected ordered key.
`populate_migration_boundaries` executes it and the explain path explains it, so
both use the identical SQL; the run id and chunk size are inlined (both bigint).
Identifiers are quoted with `%I` and every kind is checked against the
`bigint`/`text`/`uuid`/`timestamptz` whitelist (`22023` otherwise). The statement
text itself lives in `format_boundary_population_sql`.

### `dml_utils_lib.synthetic_chunk_boundary_values(i_key_kinds, i_chunk_size)`

```sql
i_key_kinds  text[]
i_chunk_size bigint
RETURNS TABLE
    (o_is_final boolean, o_start_values text [], o_end_values text [])
```

`IMMUTABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns two representative chunk ranges, one
per key kind and in key order: the non-final (`o_is_final` false) and final (`o_is_final` true) rows. `bigint` spans
`0..chunk_size`, `text` uses `a..b`, `uuid` the first two all-zero forms and
`timestamptz` two consecutive days. The values are synthetic, so the explain
path can render a plausible chunk predicate without reading real boundaries.
Rejects malformed kinds or a non-positive chunk size (`22023`).

### `dml_utils_lib.explain_query_plan(i_sql_text)`

```sql
i_sql_text text
RETURNS json
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` of `i_sql_text`
as a json value, without executing it (no `ANALYZE`): an INSERT or UPDATE only
plans. Rejects a NULL, empty or blank statement (`22023`). It is `VOLATILE`
because PostgreSQL forbids `EXPLAIN` in a non-volatile function.

###

`dml_utils_lib.explain_chunk_plans(i_sql_text, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds, i_chunk_size [, i_chunk_by])`

```sql
i_sql_text            dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_schema_name         dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name          dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_alias         dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_key_columns         name[]
i_key_kinds           text[]
i_chunk_size          bigint
i_chunk_by            dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy DEFAULT 'primary_key'
RETURNS TABLE
    (o_plan_kind text, o_sql_text text, o_plan json)
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Renders and explains the three statements a
chunked run generates — the boundary-population insert (synthetic run id `0`), a
non-final chunk and the final chunk — using synthetic ranges and reading no
boundaries. For `primary_key` the boundary plan is the key boundary
insert and the chunk plans are a `<` non-final and a `<=` final range; for
`blocks` the boundary plan is the block boundary insert and both chunk plans are
half-open ctid ranges. Shared by `explain_migration_chunks` and
`explain_function_over_table`.

###

`dml_utils_lib.explain_chunk_plan(i_sql_text, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds, i_start_values, i_end_values, i_is_final)`

```sql
i_sql_text            dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_schema_name         dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name          dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_alias         dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_key_columns         name[]
i_key_kinds           text[]
i_start_values        text[]
i_end_values          text[]
i_is_final            boolean
RETURNS TABLE
    (o_plan_kind text, o_sql_text text, o_plan json)
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The explicit-boundary companion to
`explain_chunk_plans`: it renders one key chunk from the supplied
boundaries and returns its `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` plan as a single
`chunk_non_final` or `chunk_final` row. The range is validated and cast by
`render_chunk_sql`, so a reversed or empty range is rejected with `22023`. It is
the shared implementation of `dml_utils.explain_migration_chunk` and
`dml_utils.explain_function_over_table_chunk`.

### `dml_utils_lib.build_block_boundary_population_sql(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_run_id, i_chunk_size)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_run_id      bigint
i_chunk_size  bigint
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the statement that inserts a block-chunked
run's boundaries as the contiguous sequence `0..N`: one start boundary every
`i_chunk_size` heap blocks plus a one-past-end terminal boundary, each a bigint
block number in `migration_key`. The block count comes from `pg_relation_size`
and the server block size at execution time, so no table scan is needed; a table
with no blocks yields no boundaries. See the block-strategy limitations above.

### `dml_utils_lib.boundary_key_descriptor_sql(i_key_columns, i_key_kinds)`

```sql
i_key_columns name[]
i_key_kinds   text[]
RETURNS TABLE
(o_select_list text, o_id_list text, o_order_by text,
    o_order_by_desc text, o_pack_expression text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates a one-to-three-column boundary key (one-dimensional, 1-based, matching lengths,
known kinds) and returns the SQL
fragments that read, order and pack it: the `idN`-aliased select list, the `idN`
list, the ascending and descending `ORDER BY`, and the `migration_key` row
expression. Shared by the single-relation and per-leaf boundary builders so the
key logic cannot drift.

###

`dml_utils_lib.build_leaf_boundary_population_sql(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds, i_run_id, i_chunk_size, i_leaf_ordinal)`

```sql
i_schema_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name   dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_key_columns  name[]
i_key_kinds    text[]
i_run_id       bigint
i_chunk_size   bigint
i_leaf_ordinal integer
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the statement that scans one leaf in
boundary-key order and inserts its chunk **starts** only (no per-leaf terminal)
after the boundaries already committed for the run, tagged with
`i_leaf_ordinal`. The base `boundary_no` is `max(boundary_no) + 1` over the run's
existing boundaries, so the flat sequence stays contiguous across commits.

###

`dml_utils_lib.build_block_leaf_boundary_population_sql(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_run_id, i_chunk_size, i_leaf_ordinal)`

```sql
i_schema_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name   dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_run_id       bigint
i_chunk_size   bigint
i_leaf_ordinal integer
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. The blocks-strategy per-leaf companion: inserts one
start every `i_chunk_size` heap blocks of the leaf, appended after the run's
existing boundaries and tagged with the leaf ordinal. A leaf with no blocks
yields no starts.

### `dml_utils_lib.migration_run_boundary_key(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS TABLE
    (o_key_columns name [], o_key_kinds text [])
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the boundary key a run chunks by: NULL for
`blocks`, the stored ordered-key descriptor for `ordered_key`, and the driving
parent's primary key for `primary_key`. Resolved once so every leaf uses the same
key order.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_migration_leaf_unchanged(i_run_id, i_leaf_ordinal)`

```sql
i_run_id       bigint
i_leaf_ordinal integer
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Fails closed with `invalid_transaction_initiation`
(`55000`) when the manifest leaf no longer matches the live relation: missing,
replaced (different OID), detached or rebound (different partition bound), not an
ordinary table, or (for `blocks`) a rewritten heap (different
`pg_relation_filepath`). Used before calculating a leaf and before finalizing, so
a changed partition tree never mixes stale ranges with new ones.

### `dml_utils_lib.leaf_terminal_boundary_id(i_run_id, i_leaf_ordinal)`

```sql
i_run_id       bigint
i_leaf_ordinal integer
RETURNS dml_utils_data.migration_key
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the high-water key of a leaf: the last row
in the run's key order, or the one-past-end block number for `blocks`. Used by
`finalize_migration_boundaries` for the run's single terminal boundary.

### `dml_utils_lib.calculate_migration_leaf(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS integer
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY DEFINER` (pinned `search_path`). Calculates one leaf in the
caller's transaction: locks the run row, returns NULL when the run is finalized,
cancelled or fully calculated, otherwise claims the first `pending`, `failed` or
stale `calculating` leaf in manifest order, re-checks it with
`assert_migration_leaf_unchanged`, checks the effective caller's `SELECT` on the
leaf, appends its chunk starts and marks it `calculated` with its boundary count
and a snapshot of the leaf's high-water key. Returns the ordinal. The run-row lock
serializes calculation for the run.

### `dml_utils_lib.finalize_migration_boundaries(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY DEFINER` (pinned `search_path`). Writes the run's single
terminal high-water boundary from the last non-empty leaf's calculation-time
snapshot, then sets `boundaries_calculated_at` and `total_chunks` (`0` when every
leaf is empty) in one update. Idempotent: a finalized or cancelled run is a no-op, and it raises
`55000` while any leaf is still uncalculated.

###

`dml_utils_lib.render_block_chunk_sql(i_sql_text, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_start_block, i_end_block)`

```sql
i_sql_text     dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_schema_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name   dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_alias  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_start_block  bigint
i_end_block    bigint
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Substitutes `<driving_table>` and a half-open ctid
range for `<chunking_clause>`, for example
`((t.ctid) >= ('(0,0)'::tid) AND (t.ctid) < ('(1000,0)'::tid))`. Every chunk,
including the terminal one, uses a half-open range; the terminal end is the
one-past-end block count. Rejects a NULL, reversed or empty range and a bad
template (`22023`).

### `dml_utils_lib.relation_filepath(i_schema_name, i_table_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the table's `pg_relation_filepath` (its
physical file, relative to the data directory), the fingerprint a block run
records; raises `undefined_table` (`42P01`) when the table does not exist.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_relation_filepath(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_expected_filepath)`

```sql
i_schema_name       dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name        dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_expected_filepath text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `invalid_parameter_value` (`22023`) when the
table's current filepath differs from the recorded one, so a block-chunked run
fails closed after a heap rewrite instead of resuming stale block boundaries. A
NULL expectation (a primary-key run) is a no-op.

### `dml_utils_lib.process_migration_chunk(i_run_id, i_boundary_no, i_sql_text)`

```sql
i_run_id      bigint
i_boundary_no bigint
i_sql_text    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER` for the chunk SQL. Claims one boundary through the
owner-owned `claim_migration_boundary` helper (which locks the row for the
caller's transaction and returns the claim timestamp), runs the fully-formed
chunk SQL as the caller, then completes the boundary through the owner-owned
`complete_migration_boundary` helper, which writes both timestamps and advances
the run's `total_chunks_completed` in that same transaction. Raises
`P0C01` when the boundary does not exist, is already completed or was cancelled.
If the chunk SQL fails, the transaction aborts and the claim rolls back —
including `started_at` — so the chunk is retried on the next run. A boundary
therefore reports `started_at` only for a chunk that actually completed; this is
intended. Intended to run inside a `pg_background` worker, one call per chunk.

### `dml_utils_lib.record_migration_error(i_run_id, i_boundary_no, i_sqlstate, i_message)`

```sql
i_run_id      bigint
i_boundary_no bigint
i_sqlstate    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_message     dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Inserts one row into `dml_utils_data.migration_error` for a
failed chunk worker. Intended to run inside a `pg_background` worker so the row
commits autonomously; `run_migration_chunks` calls it that way before re-raising
a chunk failure, so the error outlives the aborted caller transaction.

### `dml_utils_lib.build_key_render_columns(i_table_alias, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds)`

```sql
i_table_alias dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_key_columns name[]
i_key_kinds   text[]
RETURNS record
    (o_column_names text[], o_key_collations text[])
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates the key columns and kinds once, returns the
alias-qualified quoted column names and the collation to use for each text column (the quoted column collation,
`"default"`, or NULL when the column is not in the
catalog). `prepare_chunk_sql_render` uses it to build the run-invariant render
context.

###

`dml_utils_lib.build_chunk_boundary_literals(i_column_names, i_key_kinds, i_key_collations, i_start_values, i_end_values)`

```sql
i_column_names   text[]
i_key_kinds      text[]
i_key_collations text[]
i_start_values   text[]
i_end_values     text[]
RETURNS record
    (o_start_literals text[], o_end_literals text[],
     o_first_difference integer, o_first_difference_position integer)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates the start/end boundary values, renders
their typed SQL literals and reports the first differing column with its
direction (zero when all values are equal). A NULL value, an invalid literal for
its kind or a malformed array raises `22023`. Shared by
`render_prepared_chunk_sql`.

###

`dml_utils_lib.build_chunk_range_boxes(i_column_names, i_start_literals, i_end_literals, i_first_difference_position, i_is_final)`

```sql
i_column_names             text[]
i_start_literals           text[]
i_end_literals             text[]
i_first_difference_position integer
i_is_final                 boolean
RETURNS text[]
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Decomposes a lexicographic `[start, end)` range into
the axis-aligned box disjunction the renderer emits. The position is the first
column whose bounds differ (zero when all are equal); `i_is_final` makes the last
column's upper bound inclusive. Shared by `render_prepared_chunk_sql`.

### `dml_utils_lib.boundary_key_pack_expression(i_key_kinds)`

```sql
i_key_kinds text[]
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Builds the `migration_key` row expression for a
one-to-three-column boundary key, placing each kind's `idN` term in its
position-aligned array. Unsupported or NULL kinds and a malformed array raise
`22023`. Shared by `boundary_key_descriptor_sql`.

###

`dml_utils_lib.format_boundary_population_sql(i_select_list, i_order_by, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_id_list, i_pack_expression, i_order_by_desc, i_run_id, i_chunk_size)`

```sql
i_select_list     text
i_order_by        text
i_schema_name     text
i_table_name      text
i_id_list         text
i_pack_expression text
i_order_by_desc   text
i_run_id          bigint
i_chunk_size      bigint
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the single-relation boundary-population
statement from the key descriptor fragments: it streams the boundary key in
index order, materialises only the chunk starts and takes the terminal boundary
from a backward index scan. Shared by `build_boundary_population_sql` so the
runner and the explain path use the identical SQL.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_ordered_key_index_usable(i_index_oid, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_index_oid  oid
i_schema_name text
i_table_name  text
i_index_name  text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Validates the index-level ordered-key contract: the
OID exists and belongs to the named table, is a unique valid/ready/live btree,
is not partial or expression-based, has one to three key columns and is
ascending with NULLS LAST. A missing or mismatched OID is `42704`, an unsafe
shape is `0A000`/`22023`, and an unusable index is `55000`.

### `dml_utils_lib.ordered_key_column_attributes(i_index_oid, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_index_oid  oid
i_schema_name text
i_table_name  text
i_index_name  text
RETURNS TABLE
(ordinality integer, column_name name, column_oid oid,
    column_type regtype, key_kind text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Resolves the key columns of an index already
accepted by `assert_ordered_key_index_usable`: each column must collapse to a
supported kind, be NOT NULL, use its default btree operator class and keep its
column collation. Returns the key columns in index order.

### `dml_utils_lib.resolve_partitioned_ordered_key_index(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS oid
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Resolves the named unique index on a declarative
partitioned parent, checks the parent relkind and validates the parent index
shape, returning its OID for the leaf walk. Missing index `42704`,
non-partitioned parent `0A000`, unusable parent `0A000`/`55000`.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_partitioned_ordered_key_child_indexes(i_index_oid, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_index_name)`

```sql
i_index_oid  oid
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_index_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Walks the storage leaves of a partition-wise
ordered-key run and requires each leaf's matching descendant child index to
exist and satisfy the ordered-key contract. A missing child is `0A000`; an
unusable child is `0A000`/`55000`.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_partitioned_leaf_relations(i_parent)`

```sql
i_parent oid
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `42809` when any storage leaf of the
partitioned parent is not an ordinary table, so a foreign-table leaf is
rejected before a run or manifest row exists.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_partitioned_leaf_privileges(i_parent)`

```sql
i_parent oid
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `42501` when the caller cannot SELECT any
storage leaf of the partitioned parent, so a partition-wise run fails before
creating a manifest row.

### `dml_utils_lib.manifest_leaf_identity(i_run_id, i_leaf_ordinal)`

```sql
i_run_id      bigint
i_leaf_ordinal integer
RETURNS record
    (o_chunk_by dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy, o_leaf_schema_name text,
     o_leaf_name text, o_leaf_oid oid, o_leaf_bound text,
     o_relation_filepath text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the stored identity of one partition-wise
manifest leaf: chunk strategy, schema, name, OID, partition bound and blocks
filepath. A missing run/leaf is `55000`.

###

`dml_utils_lib.assert_live_leaf_matches_manifest(i_chunk_by, i_leaf_schema_name, i_leaf_name, i_leaf_oid, i_leaf_bound, i_relation_filepath)`

```sql
i_chunk_by           dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy
i_leaf_schema_name   text
i_leaf_name          text
i_leaf_oid           oid
i_leaf_bound         text
i_relation_filepath  text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Compares one manifest leaf identity with the live
relation and raises `55000` when it is missing, replaced (different OID),
detached or rebound (different partition bound), not a plain table, or (for
blocks) a rewritten heap.

###

`dml_utils_lib.resolve_function_chunk_target(i_table_schema_name, i_table_name, i_function_schema_name, i_function_name)`

```sql
i_table_schema_name    dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name           dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_function_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_function_name        dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS record
    (o_primary_key_columns name[], o_call_arguments text)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Resolves the per-row function target for
`run_function_over_table`: returns the driving table's primary-key columns and
the `t.<column>` call argument list after checking the function exists, is an
ordinary function, returns void and takes exactly the primary-key column types in
key order (`22023` otherwise). `build_function_chunk_template` owns the statement
text.

### `dml_utils_lib.explain_block_chunk_plans(i_sql_text, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_chunk_size)`

```sql
i_sql_text   dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_alias dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_chunk_size bigint
RETURNS TABLE
    (o_plan_kind text, o_sql_text text, o_plan json)
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the EXPLAIN plans for a blocks run: the
boundary insert and two representative half-open ctid ranges. No run or boundary
is read or written. Shared by `explain_chunk_plans`.

###

`dml_utils_lib.explain_key_chunk_plans(i_sql_text, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_table_alias, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds, i_chunk_size)`

```sql
i_sql_text   dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_alias dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_key_columns name[]
i_key_kinds   text[]
i_chunk_size  bigint
RETURNS TABLE
    (o_plan_kind text, o_sql_text text, o_plan json)
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the EXPLAIN plans for a key-chunked run:
the boundary insert and a representative non-final and final chunk rendered from
synthetic ranges. No run or boundary is read or written. Shared by
`explain_chunk_plans`.

### `dml_utils_lib.claim_next_migration_leaf(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS TABLE
(o_leaf_ordinal integer, o_leaf_schema_name text, o_leaf_name text,
    o_chunk_by dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy, o_chunk_size integer)
```

`SECURITY DEFINER`. Locks the run and claims the first pending/failed/
stale-calculating leaf in manifest order, verifies it still matches the manifest,
checks the effective caller can SELECT it and marks it `calculating`. Returns the
leaf identity plus the run's chunk strategy and size, or no row when the run is
finalized, cancelled or fully calculated.

###

`dml_utils_lib.leaf_boundary_population_sql(i_chunk_by, i_chunk_size, i_leaf_schema_name, i_leaf_name, i_run_id, i_leaf_ordinal)`

```sql
i_chunk_by          dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy
i_chunk_size        integer
i_leaf_schema_name  text
i_leaf_name         text
i_run_id            bigint
i_leaf_ordinal      integer
RETURNS text
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the statement that appends one claimed
leaf's chunk starts, using the blocks builder or the run's stored key descriptor.
`calculate_migration_leaf` executes it.

### `dml_utils_lib.calculate_next_leaf_in_worker(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS integer
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Runs one `calculate_migration_leaf` step in its own
`pg_background` transaction and returns the calculated ordinal (NULL when no leaf
is left). A failing leaf is recorded on the manifest in its own worker
transaction before the worker error is re-raised.

### `dml_utils_lib.finalize_calculated_run(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Finalizes a partition-wise run after every leaf is
calculated: rejects a pending leaf with `55000`, re-checks the live tree against
the manifest and writes the terminal boundary and totals in an autonomous worker
transaction. A cancelled or already finalized run is left untouched.

### `dml_utils_lib.terminal_leaf_for_run(i_run_id)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
RETURNS record
    (o_leaf_ordinal integer, o_leaf_schema_name text, o_leaf_name text,
     o_bigint_values bigint[], o_text_values text[], o_uuid_values uuid[],
     o_timestamptz_values timestamptz[])
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the last non-empty manifest leaf of a
partition-wise run with its stored high-water key arrays, or NULL fields when
every leaf is empty.

### `dml_utils_lib.append_terminal_boundary(i_run_id, i_leaf_ordinal, i_leaf_schema_name, i_leaf_name, i_terminal_key)`

```sql
i_run_id            bigint
i_leaf_ordinal      integer
i_leaf_schema_name  text
i_leaf_name         text
i_terminal_key      dml_utils_data.migration_key
RETURNS bigint
```

`SECURITY DEFINER`. Appends the single terminal boundary after the last committed
boundary, tagged with the terminal leaf, and returns its boundary number (the
run's chunk count). Re-checks the caller's SELECT privilege and the terminal leaf
identity, and rejects a missing snapshot with `55000`.

### `dml_utils_lib.assert_caller_can_select_relation(i_schema_name, i_table_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS void
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Raises `42501` when the effective caller cannot
SELECT the relation, before a definer-backed scan reads it.

###

`dml_utils_lib.resolve_migration_creation_key(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_chunk_by, i_boundary_key_index, i_partition_wise)`

```sql

     o_ordered_key_index name, o_ordered_key_columns name[],
     o_ordered_key_kinds text[])
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Resolves the key descriptor and filepath a new run
stores: the primary key, the ordered descriptor, or the single-relation blocks
filepath. Partition-wise blocks leaves the run-level filepath NULL.

###

`dml_utils_lib.snapshot_partition_leaf_manifest(i_run_id, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_chunk_by, i_boundary_key_index)`

```sql
i_run_id            bigint
i_schema_name       dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name        dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_chunk_by          dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy
i_boundary_key_index name
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY DEFINER`. Snapshots one pending manifest row per storage leaf with its
identity, bound and blocks filepath, validates every ordered-key child index and
requires the effective caller to SELECT every stored leaf (`42501`).

###

`dml_utils_lib.populate_single_relation_boundaries(i_run_id, i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_chunk_by, i_key_columns, i_key_kinds, i_chunk_size)`

```sql
i_run_id      bigint
i_schema_name dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_table_name  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
i_chunk_by    dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy
i_key_columns name[]
i_key_kinds   text[]
i_chunk_size  dml_utils_data.positive_integer
RETURNS void
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Inserts a single-relation run's contiguous `0..N`
boundaries in one statement and records `boundaries_calculated_at` and
`total_chunks`. Called from `populate_migration_boundaries`' definer context, so
the metadata write runs as the owner.

### `dml_utils_lib.find_active_migration_run(i_label)`

```sql
i_label dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS SETOF dml_utils_data.migration_run
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Returns the active (not archived) run for a label,
or no row.

###

`dml_utils_lib.resume_migration_run(i_run, i_driving_table_schema_name, i_driving_table_name, i_sql_text, i_chunk_size, i_threads, i_driving_table_alias, i_chunk_by, i_sleep_ms, i_boundary_key_index, i_partition_wise)`

```sql

     o_effective_threads integer, o_effective_sleep_ms integer,
     o_chunk_by dml_utils_data.chunking_strategy, o_partition_wise boolean)
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Resolves a resumed run's effective inputs from
its stored row, emits notices for differing call inputs, re-validates a stored
ordered-key descriptor (failing closed with `55000`) and asserts the stored
blocks relation filepath.

###

`dml_utils_lib.create_migration_run(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_label, i_sql_text, i_chunk_size, i_threads, i_chunk_by, i_driving_table_alias, i_sleep_ms, i_boundary_key_index, i_partition_wise)`

```sql

i_boundary_key_index name
i_partition_wise     dml_utils_data.non_null_boolean
RETURNS bigint
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. Creates a new run by calling `populate_migration_boundaries`
in a `pg_background` worker, so the run and its boundaries commit autonomously,
and returns the run id.

### `dml_utils_lib.prepare_partition_wise_execution(i_run_id, i_label)`

```sql
i_run_id bigint
i_label  dml_utils_data.non_null_text
RETURNS boolean
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Prepares a partition-wise run for processing:
finishes any pending one-leaf-per-transaction calculation, returns false after
marking a run cancelled during calculation, and compares the live tree with the
manifest. Returns true when the run is ready.

###

`dml_utils_lib.next_migration_chunk(i_run_id, i_partition_wise, i_key_kinds, i_in_flight_boundaries, i_default_schema_name, i_default_table_name)`

```sql
i_run_id                  bigint
i_partition_wise          boolean
i_key_kinds               text[]
i_in_flight_boundaries    bigint[]
i_default_schema_name     text
i_default_table_name      text
RETURNS record
    (o_boundary_no bigint, o_chunk_schema_name text, o_chunk_table_name text,
     o_start_values text[], o_end_values text[], o_is_final boolean)
```

`STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Selects the next unclaimed boundary (not in
flight), extracts its start/end keys and, for a partition-wise run, ends the
last chunk of each leaf at the manifest high-water snapshot with an inclusive
bound. Returns no boundary number when nothing is left.

### `dml_utils_lib.record_migration_worker_failure(i_run_id, i_boundary_no, i_sqlstate, i_error_message)`

```sql
i_run_id        bigint
i_boundary_no   bigint
i_sqlstate      text
i_error_message text
RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Records a failed chunk in
`dml_utils_data.migration_error` through an autonomous `pg_background`
transaction, swallowing a recording failure so the caller can still re-raise
the worker error.

### `dml_utils_lib.sleep_between_migration_chunks(i_run_id, i_sleep_ms)`

```sql
i_run_id  bigint
i_sleep_ms integer
RETURNS timestamptz
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Sleeps the run's per-chunk delay in 100ms slices
and returns the run's `cancelled_at` if cancellation was noticed, so the
coordinator can stop launching promptly.

### `dml_utils_lib.stop_migration_workers(i_pids, i_cookies, i_cancel, i_wait_ms)`

```sql
i_pids    integer[]
i_cookies bigint[]
i_cancel  boolean
i_wait_ms integer
RETURNS void
```

`VOLATILE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`. Cancels (when requested) and waits for/detaches a
set of `pg_background` worker handles given as parallel pid/cookie arrays. A NULL
wait timeout waits indefinitely; per-worker errors are swallowed so the
coordinator can finish its own error path.

## `dml_utils_data`

### `dml_utils_data.set_updated_at()`

```sql
RETURNS trigger
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. The shared `BEFORE UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger function
that stamps `NEW.updated_at := now()` on every table, so no caller can bypass
it. Attach it to each table with a trigger named `<table>_set_updated_at`; see
`changes/sql_changes/006-create-migration-tables.sql`.

### `dml_utils_data.reject_migration_run_update()`

```sql
RETURNS trigger
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`, not callable by users (PUBLIC `EXECUTE` is revoked and it is
granted to no one). The `BEFORE UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger on
`migration_run` that rejects any change to `label`, `chunk_size`, `chunk_by`,
`partition_wise`, the ordered-key descriptor (`ordered_key_index`,
`ordered_key_columns`, `ordered_key_kinds`) or the driving table (`driving_table_schema_name`, `driving_table_name`,
`driving_table_relation_filepath`), all fixed when the run is created or (for the
filepath) when its boundaries are computed, and to `total_chunks` once
`boundaries_calculated_at` is set (the two are written together);
`total_chunks_completed` stays mutable for the chunk workers.

### `dml_utils_data.reject_migration_boundary_update()`

```sql
RETURNS trigger
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`, not callable by users (PUBLIC `EXECUTE` is revoked and it is
granted to no one). The `BEFORE UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger on
`migration_boundary` that rejects any change to `run_id`, `boundary_no`,
`boundary_id` or `leaf_ordinal`, all fixed when the boundaries are computed.

### `dml_utils_data.check_migration_run_leaf()`

```sql
RETURNS trigger
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`, not callable by users (PUBLIC `EXECUTE` is revoked and it is
granted to no one). The `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger on
`migration_run_leaf` that requires the run to exist and be partition-wise,
requires a `relation_filepath` exactly when the run's `chunk_by` is `blocks`, and
rejects any change to the snapshotted leaf identity (`run_id`, `leaf_ordinal`,
`leaf_schema_name`, `leaf_name`, `leaf_oid`, `leaf_bound`, `relation_filepath`)
on update. The calculation state, count, timestamp and error fields stay mutable.

### `dml_utils_data.check_migration_boundary_leaf()`

```sql
RETURNS trigger
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`, not callable by users (PUBLIC `EXECUTE` is revoked and it is
granted to no one). The `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger on
`migration_boundary` that requires `leaf_ordinal` for a partition-wise run and
rejects it for a single-relation run; the composite foreign key resolves the
ordinal to the run's leaf manifest. On update it returns early when the run and
leaf are unchanged, so the claim/complete path does not repeat the catalog
lookup.
