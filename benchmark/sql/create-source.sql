-- Deterministic benchmark source table.
--
-- Created outside the Liquibase-managed schemas: it is a benchmark fixture, not
-- application schema, so it carries only the columns the workload reads. Run by
-- benchmark/setup.sh with :schema, :source_table, :rows, :pk_def, :pk_key and
-- :pk_exprs set. The primary key is one to three bigint columns, matching the
-- chunking engine. The :pk_def, :pk_key and :pk_exprs variables must each stay on
-- one line: a psql variable is only substituted when the name follows the colon
-- with no whitespace, so a formatter that splits them breaks the script.
