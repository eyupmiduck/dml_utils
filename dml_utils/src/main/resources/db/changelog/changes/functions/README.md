# Stored functions

One function per `.sql` file, grouped by the schema that owns it:

- `dml_utils/` — the application surface, including the shared `set_updated_at()`
  trigger.
- `dml_utils_lib/` — generic helpers that take their parameters explicitly.

`changes/functions.xml` loads them one `createProcedure` per `runOnChange`
changeset; the matching drop lives in `changes/functions-rollback/`. Every
routine is `SECURITY INVOKER` unless it genuinely needs `SECURITY DEFINER`.

Each routine file ends with a `COMMENT ON FUNCTION` (or `COMMENT ON PROCEDURE`)
for the routine it creates, using the short form (`schema.name`, no argument
list). If a routine is ever overloaded, include its argument types so the
comment targets the right overload.

## `dml_utils`

### `dml_utils.set_updated_at()`

```sql
RETURNS trigger
```

`SECURITY INVOKER`. The shared `BEFORE UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger function
that stamps `NEW.updated_at := now()` on every table, so no caller can bypass
it. Attach it to each table with a trigger named `<table>_set_updated_at`; see
`changes/sql_changes/003-create-example-table.sql`.
