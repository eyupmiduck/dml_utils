-- Deterministic partition-wise ordered-key benchmark source table.
--
-- The ordered_key fixture shape (a UUID primary key with a (created_at, id)
-- unique index) made declaratively partitioned by hashing the primary key, so a
-- partition-wise ordered_key run has several leaves to calculate and process.
-- The hash partition key is `id`, which is part of both the primary key and the
-- (created_at, id) ordered index, so PostgreSQL accepts both unique constraints
-- on the parent and creates the matching child indexes automatically.
--
-- Run by benchmark/setup.sh with :schema, :source_table, :rows, :index and
-- :leaves set. The :index variable must stay on one line: a psql variable is
-- only substituted when the name follows the colon with no whitespace.
