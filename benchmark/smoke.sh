# Run a small end-to-end smoke test of the benchmark harness.
#
# Creates an isolated benchmark database, runs one measured run per chunking
# strategy (primary_key and blocks) with two threads, and removes the database
# again. The dataset is tiny and deterministic, and config.local.env is ignored,
# so the result does not depend on a developer's personal sweep.
#
# Intended for CI (see .github/workflows/benchmark-smoke.yml) and for checking a
# changelog or benchmark change locally. Pass --keep to leave the database
# running for inspection.
#
# Usage: benchmark/smoke.sh [--keep]
