 * database, then the current changelog, so an upgrade that only works on an
 * empty database fails here.

 * <p>The previous release is resolved from GitHub Packages automatically. The
 * upgrade configuration shares every value with the regular test base except the
 * master changelog: the upgrade test must apply the plain dml_utils changelog,
 * not the install changelog that bundles ddl_utils.
